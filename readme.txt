After activating your groups will have ability to create any custom fields they want. Also extra page will appear with chosen content.

== Description ==

BuddyPress Groups doesn't have much predefined content inside. Forums and activity are created (or not) by users. But most of the time group creators (aka administrators) have much more to say or explain to other members of community.

BuddyPress Groups Extras will give ability to them to create extra content.

= General =
* Choose groups you want to allow custom fields and pages
* Define who will have access to managing fields or pages in groups (groups admins or site admins or both)
* Create predefined Set of Fields that can be imported to all groups on a site OR can be imported on per group basis
* Get tutorials on how to use the plugin (simplified and advanced variants) right in your admin area

= Groups Custom Fields =
* Create custom fields using various type (radios, checkboxes, dropdown select, textarea and text)
* Edit fields data on Edit Group Details page in Group Admin area
* Display / hide page, where all groups fields will be displayed (and rename it too)
* Reorder fields

= Groups Custom Pages =
* Create group pages (for group FAQ or wiki, or events, or descriptions or whatever you want)
* Edit pages data in Group Admin area using WP RichEditor (with embedding content that WordPress supports!)
* Display / hide page, where all groups pages will be displayed (and rename it too)
* Reorder pages

And even more in PRO version:

* include groups pages and fields into global groups search
* have a flexible access management to allow members see groups extra content only when they have rights
* several groups top levels pages
* group blog (collaborative or not) posts
* group polls
* and much more.

Make your groups full of possibilities!

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin folder `/buddypress-groups-extras/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to BP Groups Extras under Settings menu and make customisations as needed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't I see Fields/Pages in group navigation after plugin activation and enabling it for that particular group? =
Please go to group admin area and define Fields and Pages navigation labels and check them to Show. This is done to prevent displaying empty pages with no content.

= How can I change the look and feel of a plugin output in groups? =
= How can I redefine templates? =
Starting from BPGE v3.6 you can now change the html that is used to display any content in front-end (in groups) right from your theme folder. This is useful if you want to change the way pages and fields are displayed, but it works for "Admin -> Extras" management pages as well.

To do this you need to create a folder called `bpge` in the root of your theme. So for example if you use Frisco theme, create a folder like this: `wp-content/themes/frisco-for-buddypress/bpge`. Then copy required file (that you want to modify) from this plugin folder `wp-content/plugins/buddypress-groups-extras/views/front` to that created in a theme. That is it - now the plugin uses the template from your theme.
